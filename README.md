# Pre-work - *TipCalculator*

**TipCalculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Yi Sien Ku**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Added splitting feature that would calculate the total split amount based on the given number of splits.

## Notes

My biggest challenge was not owning a Macbook to develop this pre project as mine stopped working due to a water damage accident. Hence time became one of my biggest challenges too, as I was only able to get my hands on a MacBook after finally able to loan one on  02/02/2022 from my university which was less than 2 days before the deadline. I will get my mac book fixed though before the start of the course! Overall, the code was definitely straight forward and simple, but if I had more time to work on it I would definitely add a lot more features to the app.
